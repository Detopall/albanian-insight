# Albanian Insight

## Introduction

I have a Kosovo Albanian background, but my reading and comprehension of the Albanian language is limited. Albanian is my mother tongue, but I have never been to school in Kosovo or actually studied the language as one would formally do in school.

With this I've created the "Albanian Insight" project. The project is a collection of tools and resources that I've found useful in learning the Albanian language, such as the POS (Part of Speech) tagger, the theme, the sentiment and the translation of a text.

## POS Tagger

The POS tagger is a tool that tags the words in a text with their part of speech. The POS tagger is useful for understanding the structure of a text and for identifying the parts of speech in a text.

## Theme

LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) is a topic modeling technique that is used to identify the themes in a text. The theme is useful for understanding the main topics in a text and for identifying the main themes in a text.

## Sentiment

The sentiment analysis is a tool that is used to identify the sentiment of a text. The sentiment is useful for understanding the emotions in a text and for identifying the sentiment of a text.

## Translation

Using the Google Translate API, the translation tool is used to translate a text from one language to another. The translation is useful for understanding the meaning of a text and for translating a text from one language to another (Albanian to English).

## Usage

To use the tools in the "Albanian Insight" project, you can use the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

A FastAPI server will be started on `http://localhost:8000`.
